# Masters Thesis: Using Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Forecast Day-Ahead Electricity Prices

## Project Overview

The application of Neural Networks (NN) in trading and price forecasting in energy markets is increasingly gaining attention. Specifically, the use of machine learning (ML) in predicting energy market behaviors has been a focal point of several studies and industry applications. However, the rapid evolution of power systems presents challenges and opportunities for ML applications in this field. This project delves into these aspects, exploring the effectiveness and adaptability of ML models in the context of the Great Britain (GB) electricity market.
